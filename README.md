# GSOC-Chaoss
This repo is to show my work that I have done on Idea: [Support of Source Code Related Metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/182).   

My Solution for the Microtasks:

**Microtask 1:**

In microtask 1 we have to set up Perceval to be executed from PyCharm. Which can be found at [micro1](microtask1).<br />

**Microtask 2:**

In microtask 2 I have to create a Python script to execute Perceval via its Python interface using the Git and GitHub backends. Feel free to select any target repository, for instance the GitHub repository hosting Perceval. It can be found at [Microtask2](microtask2).
<br />

**Microtask 3:**<br />

In microtask 3 I have to answer various questions which can be found at [Microtask 3](microtask3).
<br />

**Microtask 4:**<br />


For Microtask 4, I have made the python script [Microtask 4](microtask4/Microtask4.py). This script finds if an given GitHub repo is on the SoftwareHeritage or not and also shows the date of last visit. The task can be found at [Microtask3](microtask3).


**Microtask 5:**<br />


In microtask 5 we have to set up Graal to be executed from PyCharm. Which can be found at [micro5](microtask5).<br />

**Microtask 6:**<br />


For Microtask 6 we have to create a Python script to execute Graal via its Python interface using the CoCom and CoLic backends. Feel free to select any target repository, for instance the GitHub repository hosting Toolkit. It can be found at [Microtask6](microtask6)

**Microtask 7:**
<br />

In microtask 7 I have to answer various questions which can be found at [Microtask 7](microtask7).
<br />
  
**Microtask 8:**


For Microtask 8, I have made the python script [Microtask 8](microtask8/Microtask8.py). This script takes the repo url and a commit SHA as inputs, then it clones that repo if it isn't there, then it checkouts to the given commit SHA and then finally performs an flake8 on that. The task can be found at [Microtask8](microtask8).


**Microtask 9:**
<br />
In microtask 9 I have to make pull requests. For this I haev made 3 pull requests whose more details can be found at [microtask 9](microtask9).
