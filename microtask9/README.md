**Description:**

1. In first pull request I solved the issue [#288](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/issues/288), In which whenever a call to sirmordred is made it used to show some warnings. To remove those warnings I added an extra Loader parameter in yaml.load() call.

2. In second pull request[#77](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/77#pullrequestreview-220427025) I fixed the typo in the sirmordred command.

3. In third pull request [#78](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/78#pullrequestreview-220426686) I soved a typo in the table name of a command.
