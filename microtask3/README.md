**7.List and explain at least 3 Git commands used by the Perceval backend (you can rely on the Git documentation)**<br />
  Git commands used by Perceval backend are :<br />
  * clone() :<br />
    syntax : clone(cls, uri, dirpath)<br />
    This method clones the repo. Make a bare copy of the repository stored in `uri` into `dirpath`.
    The repository would be either local or remote.<br />
        :param uri: URI of the repository<br />
        :param dirtpath: directory where the repository will be cloned<br />
        :returns: a `GitRepository` class having cloned the repository<br />

  * count_objects():<br />
    syntax : count_objects(self)<br />
    Count the objects of a repository.
    The method returns the total number of objects (packed and unpacked) available on the repository<br />

  * update() :<br />
    syntax : update(self)<br />
    Update repository from its remote. Calling this method, the repository will be synchronized with the remote repository using 'fetch' command for 'heads' refs. Any commit stored in the local copy will be removed; refs will be overwritten.<br />

  * sync() : <br />
    syntax : sync(self)<br />
    Keep the repository in sync. This method will synchronize the repository with its 'origin', fetching newest objects and updating references. It uses low level commands which allow to keep track of which things    have changed in the repository. The method also returns a list of hashes related to the new commits fetched during the process. It returns a list of new commits<br />
